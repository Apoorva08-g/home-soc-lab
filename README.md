# Home-soc-lab

## Overview
A home Security Operations Center (SOC) lab built to 
simulate real-world cyberattacks and practice defensive 
security skills. The lab uses Wazuh as a SIEM to monitor 
a victim machine, detect attacks in real time, and 
generate alerts mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework. 
Incidents are documented through formal incident response 
reports to simulate real SOC analyst workflows.

## Lab Architecture
- **SIEM Server:** Wazuh v4.14.5 (VirtualBox VM)
- **Victim Machine:** Ubuntu Server 22.04 (VirtualBox VM)  
- **Attacker Machine:** Kali Linux (physical machine)

## Tools Used
- Wazuh SIEM
- Kali Linux
- Hydra
- Nmap
- VirtualBox
